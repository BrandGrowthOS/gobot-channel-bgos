/**
 * Bounded FIFO cache of processed message IDs. Used to dedup inbound_message
 * events that may arrive twice via independent paths:
 *
 *   - Live WS push receives msg N
 *   - WS reconnect / poll triggerBackfill() refetches inbound since the disk
 *     cursor, re-emitting msg N if the cursor lagged behind the live emit
 *   - Two integration sockets briefly subscribed to assistant:<id> during a
 *     disconnect/reconnect race, both delivering the same payload
 *   - Backend transport-level retry
 *
 * Without dedup, the daemon dispatches each duplicate to the Gobot brain and
 * posts the reply again. Ported from openclaw-channel-bgos/src/processed-ids.ts
 * (observed in prod 2026-05-10: chat 917 had four assistant replies for two
 * user questions, including identical-text pairs 1.3s apart). The Set is
 * bounded by `capacity` (FIFO eviction by insertion order) so memory does not
 * grow unbounded for long-running daemons.
