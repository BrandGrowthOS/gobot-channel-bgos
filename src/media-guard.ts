/**
 * Outbound media-path guard.
 *
 * SECURITY (defense-in-depth): every outbound file send — `sendFile`,
 * `sendImage`, `sendVideo`, and the structured `uploadFile` — ultimately
 * hands an agent-supplied `filePath` to `publishMediaPath`, which reads it
 * off disk and ships its bytes to BGOS. Without a guard, a compromised /
 * misbehaving agent could exfiltrate ANY file the host process can read
 * (`/etc/passwd`, `~/.ssh/id_rsa`, app secrets, etc.).
 *
 * The BGOS backend is now the sole authority for chat/session resolution,
 * but it can't see the host filesystem, so the path allowlist has to live
 * here, at the boundary, before a single byte is read.
 *
 * Policy
 * ------
 *   - Resolve the requested path to an absolute, symlink-free real path.
 *   - Reject anything that isn't inside the allowed media root.
 *   - The allowed root is `GOBOT_MEDIA_ROOT` (resolved + symlink-free);
 *     when unset it defaults to `<cwd>/media`, falling back to `<cwd>`
 *     if `<cwd>/media` doesn't exist — so an out-of-the-box install can
 *     still send files the agent wrote under the working dir, while a
 *     hardened deployment can pin a narrow root.
 *   - Reject obviously-sensitive locations outright even on the off chance
 *     the root is mis-configured to a parent of them (belt + suspenders).
 *   - Reject symlinks whose real target escapes the root (handled by
 *     realpath-ing both sides before the containment check).
 *
 * On rejection we throw a clear `MediaPathError`; callers must NOT publish.
