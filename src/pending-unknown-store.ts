/**
 * Durable set of inbound message ids that arrived for an assistant NOT yet in
 * the route map and were therefore left UNCONSUMED by the inbound handler.
 *
 * Why this exists (silent-loss fix). The disk cursor (bgos_last_id) advances
 * monotonically as KNOWN messages are consumed. A sibling known message with a
 * HIGHER id than an unconsumed unknown-assistant message would push the cursor
 * PAST the hole, so inboundSince(cursor) would never return the unknown message
 * again, even after its route later heals. Worst on multi-assistant pairings
 * (one bound sibling advancing the cursor past a not-yet-bound sibling's
 * message) and null agent_route assistants.
 *
 * Persisting the pending ids lets saveLastId CLAMP the cursor so it never
 * advances past the LOWEST still-pending unknown id, keeping the inbound window
 * re-fetchable until identity heals. ProcessedIdsCache dedupes the already
 * consumed ids above the hole, so re-fetching the window is safe.
 *
 * File: `$GOBOT_HOME/bgos_pending_unknown.json` (default `~/.gobot/...`).
 * Format: JSON array of `{ id: number, at: number }` (epoch ms), insertion
 * order. Atomic writes (tmp + rename, mode 0600), same pattern as
 * last-id-store. All errors swallowed: a persistence hiccup must never crash
 * the adapter.
 *
 * Bounded to MAX_PENDING (drop-oldest). A genuinely-never-bound assistant that
 * floods the lane can therefore hold the cursor back by at most the newest
 * MAX_PENDING ids, never forever: the oldest pending ids age out and the cursor
 * is free to advance past them. This is the "cap the clamp" guard; the adapter
 * surfaces a visible heartbeat lastError while the set is stuck so the bounded
 * loss is never silent.
